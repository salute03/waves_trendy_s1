# Introduction

For this project different testing approaches where pursued. Core Testing method for Waves Trendy was manual testing and user testing. Additionally Testcases based on Django TestCase where introduced to this project to support the development process. In addition to testing the code ran through specific validation services to spot any irregularities or syntax errors. On top of that the project was posted to Code Institutes private #peer-code-review Slack Group to gather some more feedback from students and alumnis. The following documentation provides an detailed overview of the defined testcases, the automatic testing setup, validation service results and insights to challenging bugs that were encoutered during the development of this project.

# Peer-Code-Review

The project was peer-reviewed by students from code institute. Feedback was given on the readme files and the code. 

# Bug-Log from Development

The following bugs were identified and mainly fixed during development:
1. Updating userprofile even if checkbox is unchecked on Checkout form:  

   This issue was identified during the extensive testing protocoll and took a while to solve. The problem was that the used JavaScript call to check if the checkbox is checked or unchecked always returned true. Furthermore, the python code didn't identify the javascript `true`/`false` response as `True` or `False`. Therefore the functions did not process the given information as intended. The following lines were introduce to make the function work as intended:
   ```
   stripe_elements.js
   var saveInfo = $('#id-save-info').is(':checked');
   ```
   ```
   webhook_handler.py
   if save_info == "true":
   ```
2. Webhooks for orders  without the optional streetaddressline2 filled out were failing. Therefore customers who didn't provide a line2 street address were not receiving their order confirmation. The problem laid in the model definition. By allowing `null` to be `true` on `street_address2` the webhooks were processed without problems.
3. Adding products to a wishlist if no item was added before on a fresh user failed in the beginning. The solution was to use the `get_or_create` method and check if the object was created or already existed.  
4. Product images were not displayed when using the `{{MEDIA_URL}}` template tag. This was solved by extensivly checking the settings.py and by realizing that the ```django.template.context_processors.media``` was missing in the templates setup. 
5. Importing fixtures to postgres db led to some troubles. This was solved by making sure the charfields are set correct and that especially on long descriptions it makes sense to use TextField.
