# UXD Considerations

## Purpose and Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to create an ecommerce shop for sustainable clothing and some home equitment. 
The goal is to create this shop as an interactive fullstack website that allows customers to browse products, 
make purchases by credit card and if registered manage a wishlist or see their orderhistory. 
These goals should be supported by providing a clean and easy to use website that allows seamless navigation and has a low bounce rate.

## Design process
Before laying out the project and creating an initial design market research was done. 
During this research phase the following questions were also acknowledged: 
* How do other stores look?
* What are typical design patterns used across stores?
* Which site are appealing to me?
* Which kind of stores fit to my business idea? 


## Target group

The shop is targeted to women and men alike.
 The typical age of a shopper is estimated to be between 25 and 40 years. Especially couples and small families are targeted with the products. 
All customers have mindset respecting the environment and favoring sustainable products. 
 The income of the target group is an average mid to high household income. Furthermore the target group has a passion for living outdoors and owning sustainable high quality products to use in day to day life.

## Layout, Styling & Wireframes

The wireframes were created in Figma. Figma is a cloud based desing tool which allows you to rapidly create prototypes, wireframes and layouts [Figma](www.figma.com)

# Information Architecture 

## Application Framework
The project brief required to base the project on the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) application framework - "The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines". Django is an open source python web framework that takes away the burdens of regular web development and allows developers to quickly build a secure, scalable and state-of-the art app.

## Database Selection

During development the built-in SQLite3 database from django is used. However, for the deployment to Heroku a switch to postgressql was undertaken.
[Djangoâ€™s authentication system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/auth/) in combination with [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) is used to manage users and permissions.
The structure of the products and checkout app are based on the [Boutique Ado](https://github.com/ckz8780/boutique_ado_v1) project from Code Institute and customized to the specific project needs.

# Deployment

This site is deployed to heroku and the versioning was done with gitpod and the Repository is hosted on Github.


## Prerequisites to work with this Site

This project can be used for development with the following tools:

- IDE of Choie (i prefer Gitpod)
- Python3, PIP & Git should be installed

Furthermore accounts with the following services are used in this project:

- Stripe
- AWS S3 Storage
- Gmail

## Local Deployment: Step-by-Step Instructions

Official Github Documentation on cloning a repositiory: [Github - Cloning Repos]

1. Navigate to Mainpage of the repository
2. Click on "Code" button
3. Choose "Clone with HTTPs" & copy URL
4. Open Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to prefered location
6. Type git clone and past copied URL ```git clone https://github.com/salute03/waves_trendy_s1```
7. Press Enter to create local Clone - Make sure your environment supports python3 -
8. Type ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` into Terminal
9. Setup the environment variables. This process is differnet depending on the used IDE. Gitpod supports global Environments for the development process. Therefore they were stored in the settings. The following variables are needed:
    ```
    DEVELOPMENT=True   
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = <YOUR STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = <YOUR STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = <YOUR STRIPE_WH_SECRET>
    ```
10. Migrate the models and create the database by typing the following commands into the terminal:
    1. ```python3 manage.py makemigrations```  
    2. ```python3 manage.py migrate```
11. Import the provided fixtures in the following order (copy&paste if you like): 
    1. ```python3 manage.py loaddata categories```
    2. ```python3 manage.py loaddata productline```
    3. ```python3 manage.py loaddata products```
    4. ```python3 manage.py loaddata proudctsize```
    5. ```python3 manage.py loaddata productvariants```
    6. ```python3 manage.py loaddata blog ```
    7. ```python3 manage.py loaddata faq ```
12. Create a superuser for accessing the django admin view with the following command:
    ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser``` You will be asked for an email address, username and password.
13. You should be all set and when using the command ```python3 manage.py runserver``` the project should run.
14. You can access the django admin view by adding ```~/admin``` to the end of your (local) URL.

## Deployment to Heroku: Step-by-Step Instructions

This project is deployed to Heroku. For the deployment the following steps were/are necessary:

1. Create/Log in to your Heroku account and create a new App.
2. Install Heroku Add-on Heroku Postgres from the Resources tab. The free ```Hobby Dev``` version is fine. Now click the Provision button to add it to your project.
3. Create requirements.txt from your project with the help of ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt``` (already provided within the repository)
4. Create a Procfile ```echo web: gunicorn puffins.wsgi:application > Procfile``` (already provided within the repository)
5. Commit changes to Git ```git add .``` followed by ```git commit -m "Deploy: Updated Procfile"``` (already provided within the repository)
6. Set the environment variables in Heroku Settings > Reveal Config Variables
    The following Variables must be set:
    ```
    USE_AWS = TRUE
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = <YOUR AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = <YOUR AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    DATABASE_URL = <YOUR DATABASE_URL> (Set by Heroku Postgres)
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = <YOUR EMAIL_HOST_USER>
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = <YOUR EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD>
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = <YOUR DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL>
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = <YOUR STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = <YOUR STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = <YOUR STRIPE_WH_SECRET>
    ```
7. Extract the DATABASE_URL Value from the Heroku Settings and set it up in your IDE or local .env file. Make sure to keep this DATABASE_URL a secret and definitly don't commit it to Github.
8. To test if the Postgres database is connected to your IDE you can make use of the command ```python3 manage.py showmigrations```. This should show undone migrations for all models.
9. Now migrate the models and create the postgres database on heroku by typing the following commands into the terminal:
    1. ```python3 manage.py makemigrations```  
    2. ```python3 manage.py migrate```
10. To setup the data in the database import the provided fixtures in the following order (copy&paste if you like): 
    1. ```python3 manage.py loaddata categories```
    2. ```python3 manage.py loaddata productline```
    3. ```python3 manage.py loaddata products```
    4. ```python3 manage.py loaddata proudctsize```
    5. ```python3 manage.py loaddata productvariants```
11. Create a superuser for the Postgres database for accessing the django admin view with the following command:
    ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser``` You will be asked for an email address, username and password.
12. Log in to heroku from your terminal ```heroku login -i```
13. Add exisitng repository to Heroku heroku ```git:remote -a <your repository>```
14. Push changes to Heroku ```git push heroku main```
15. Visit the app url from heroku and check out your great site!
